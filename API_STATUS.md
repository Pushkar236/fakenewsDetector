# API Status and Analysis Methods

## Current Status

The NewsCheck Fake News Detector now operates with a robust fallback system that ensures functionality even when external AI services are unavailable.

## Analysis Methods

### 1. Primary AI Analysis (When Available)
- **Service**: Google Gemini AI
- **Features**: Advanced natural language processing, context understanding, fact verification
- **Accuracy**: Up to 95% confidence with detailed reasoning

### 2. Fallback Pattern Analysis (Always Available)
- **Method**: Intelligent heuristic analysis
- **Features**: Pattern recognition, emotional manipulation detection, clickbait identification
- **Accuracy**: 70-85% confidence for common misinformation patterns

## How It Works

### Pattern-Based Detection

The fallback system analyzes content for common misinformation indicators:

1. **Emotional Manipulation**
   - Detects words like "shocking", "amazing", "urgent", "breaking"
   - Identifies excessive use of emotional language
   - Flags fear-mongering tactics

2. **Clickbait Patterns**
   - Recognizes "click", "share", "subscribe" prompts
   - Detects "you won't believe" type headlines
   - Identifies sensationalized language

3. **Formatting Analysis**
   - Excessive capitalization (ALL CAPS)
   - Overuse of exclamation marks
   - Suspicious punctuation patterns

4. **Content Structure**
   - Missing source citations
   - Vague or unverifiable claims
   - Logical inconsistencies

### Scoring Algorithm

```
Suspicion Score = Emotional Words (25%) + ALL CAPS (20%) + Exclamations (15%) + Clickbait (20%) + Other Factors (20%)

Verdict Mapping:
- Score 0-20: TRUE (High credibility)
- Score 21-40: UNVERIFIED (Needs verification)
- Score 41-60: MIXED (Contains both accurate and questionable elements)
- Score 61-100: FALSE (High probability of misinformation)
```

## User Experience

### When AI is Available
- High-quality analysis with detailed explanations
- Comprehensive source verification
- Advanced context understanding
- Confidence scores typically 80-95%

### When Using Fallback
- Fast, reliable pattern-based analysis
- Clear identification of warning signs
- Educational feedback about misinformation tactics
- Confidence scores typically 30-80%

### Status Indicators

The application automatically notifies users about which analysis method is being used:

- ✅ **"Analysis completed successfully!"** - AI analysis worked
- ℹ️ **"Analysis completed using local algorithms!"** - Fallback analysis used
- ⚠️ **"Fallback analysis provided"** - AI failed, fallback succeeded

## Reliability

### Pattern Analysis Strengths
- Excellent at detecting obvious misinformation
- Fast and always available
- Good at identifying emotional manipulation
- Reliable for educational purposes

### Pattern Analysis Limitations
- Cannot verify specific factual claims
- May miss sophisticated misinformation
- Limited context understanding
- Cannot access external fact-checking databases

## Development Notes

### API Key Issues
The provided API key format (`AQ.Ab8RN6IsNt4hX1zwHGFxEVFTtSFuK5224t5YYhOKEpOorcdB8w`) doesn't match the standard Google AI API key format. This could be:

1. A different authentication method
2. A key for a different service
3. An expired or invalid key
4. A key requiring OAuth2 instead of direct API calls

### Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Fallback Analysis**
   - Domain reputation checking
   - Time-based verification (checking publication dates)
   - Cross-reference with known fact-checking databases

2. **Alternative AI Services**
   - Integration with OpenAI GPT models
   - Hugging Face transformers
   - Local AI models

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Combine multiple analysis methods
   - Weighted scoring based on available services
   - Confidence aggregation

## For Developers

To get full AI functionality:

1. Obtain a valid Google AI API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Update the `.env` file with the correct key format
3. The key should start with `AIza` for standard Google API keys

Example valid key format:
```
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## User Recommendations

1. **Always verify important information** with multiple sources
2. **Use the tool as a first check**, not a final authority
3. **Pay attention to the confidence scores** and warnings
4. **Check the recommended fact-checking sources** for verification
5. **Be aware of the analysis method** being used (AI vs. pattern-based)

The application is designed to be educational and helpful while being transparent about its limitations.
